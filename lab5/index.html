	<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
	<h2>Subject of the lab:</h2>
<p> The subject of this lab was to use what we already know about html, to create a well structured document that details:
	<ul>
		<li>the subject of this lab</li>
		<li>any difficulties we encountered</li>
		<li>the results of our work</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>Difficulties:</h2>
<p>I got confused and thought that the online lecture was for this monday instead of last wednesday and so missed this weeks class. As a result I left finding a partner and completing the lab late and missed the deadline. This meant checking my mistakes was harder without an extra pair of eyes.</p>
<h2>Results:</h2>
<p>I have included two images and two links to different websites. The second image of the whale is linked to the website of a Monterey whale watching company.</p>
