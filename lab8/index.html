<h1>Lab 8: CSS Selectors</h1>
<hr>
<div class="challenges">
	<p><h2>Challenge</h2>The objective of the lab was to experiment with CSS selectors and make a web page.</p>
</div>
<div id="poppy" class="poppy">
<img src="img/poppy.png" alt="poppy" />
</div>
<div class="problems">
	<p><h2>Problems</h2>I tried to give general CSS instructions using the 'p' selector and then specific instructions about the size of these white boxes as classes, however by only stating the sizes I lost the background. I ended up just duplicating the insructions for each class which doesn't seem very efficient and sort of defeats the point of creating classes in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div class="results">
	<p><h2>Results</h2>I didn't manage to find a partner for this lab which made solving issues much more difficult. I tried to look up how to use t ehover slector however the css help did not specify how to resize an image, only how to change the background colour. I am not sure whether chnaging the size of an image using hover would involve saving an additional image in the img folder?<p>
