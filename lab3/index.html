<h1>Lab 3 File Structure<h1/>
	<h2>The Subject of this Lab:</h2>
	  <p>The subject of this lab was to understand the importance of file structure and how to link between files<p>
	<h2>Difficulties I encountered</h2>
		<p> I struggled initially to include an image that would show in the browser. First I tried specifying the image dimensions but the actual problem was that I named the image as a png file instead of a jgp file.</p>
	<h2>The Results</h2>
		<p> In the end I was able to add the files lab6-10 by duplicating lab6</p>
		<img src="img/screenshot1.png" alt="file structure" />
		<p>I also added an index page to lab3 (which is this page)</p>
		<p>I added an image and links to labs 1-6 on the cst251 index page, here is the HTML for this in Atom:</p>
		<img src="img/screenshot2.png" alt="index html" />
		<p>And this is how it looks when viewed in browser:</p>
		<img src="img/screenshot3.png" alt="index in browser" />
