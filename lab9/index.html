	<h1>Lab 9: Styling Block Elements</h1>
<div id="content">
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>I struggled to remember how to add a border and so had to look this up. I also struggled to remember how to use hover. It took me a while to work out how to align the photo and "content" div so that the text wrapped around the image.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>I had several problems trying to change the font within the content div. I also really struggled to add a border to the image also I still haven't been able to make the image hover.</p>
  <h2>Results</h2>
	  <p>The result of this lab is this page, I didn't manage to add hover to the image.</p>
