			<h1>Lab 10: Styling Text Elements</h1>

		<div id="challenge">
			<h2>Challenge:</h2>
			  <p>The objective of this lab was to create a web page that styles text elements, to use fonts that are plain and readable and to include a font from google fonts.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="problems">
			<h2>Problems:</h2>
			  <p>I was unable to make the heading a different font without sepcifying for each section what the font should be. I thought there would have been a way to specify the fot for the "content" and then that you could specify the h1 font separately. I thought that bevause h1 is more specific than "content" id (because h1 is in the content div) that font specified in h1 would overrule that given to content div but this was not the case. The font for the content div overuled the other. I am not sure why this has happened- i don't know whether using classes rather than ids would make a difference? </p>
